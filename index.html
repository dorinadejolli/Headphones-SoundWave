            Different sound profile options. Sony's headphones generally fall
            into neutral or bass-heavy sound profile options. It helps them
            cater to a wider range of listeners since some people find a neutral
            sound too flat or boring, but others find too much bass
            overwhelming.

            <h2>Types of Headphones</h2>
            <p>
              Headphones are a pair of small loudspeaker drivers worn on or
              around the head over a user's ears.Headphones let a single user
              listen to an audio source privately, in contrast to a loudspeaker,
              which emits sound into the open air for anyone nearby to hear.
              Headphones are also known as earphones or, colloquially, cans.
              Circumaural (around the ear) and supra-aural (over the ear)
              headphones use a band over the top of the head to hold the drivers
              in place. Another type, known as earbuds or earpieces, consists of
              individual units that plug into the user's ear canal. A third type
              are bone conduction headphones, which typically wrap around the
              back of the head and rest in front of the ear canal, leaving the
              ear canal open.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="about-msgcol">
            <h2>How are Headphones connected</h2>
            <p>
              Headphones connect to a signal source such as an audio amplifier,
              radio, CD player, portable media player, mobile phone, video game
              console, or electronic musical instrument, either directly using a
              cord, or using wireless technology such as Bluetooth, DECT or FM
              radio. The first headphones were developed in the late 19th
              century for use by switchboard operators, to keep their hands
              free. Initially, the audio quality was mediocre and a step forward
              was the invention of high fidelity headphones.

          <div class="about-msgcol">
            <h2>Professional Headphones</h2>
            <p>
              In the professional audio sector, headphones are used in live
              situations by disc jockeys with a DJ mixer, and sound engineers
              for monitoring signal sources. In radio studios, DJs use a pair of
              headphones when talking to the microphone while the speakers are
              turned off to eliminate acoustic feedback while monitoring their
              own voice. In studio recordings, musicians and singers use
              headphones to play or sing along to a backing track or band. In
              military applications, audio signals of many varieties are
              monitored using headphones.

            <h2>Supra-aural Headphones</h2>
            <p>
              Supra-aural style headphones are historically the most commonly
              used in audiology as they are the easiest to calibrate and were
              considered the standard for many years. Commonly used models are
              the Telephonics Dynamic Headphone (TDH). In-the-ear or insert
              style earphones are used more commonly today as they provide
              higher levels of interaural attenuation, introduce less
              variability when testing 6,000 and 8,000 Hz, and avoid testing
              issues resulting from collapsed ear canals.
